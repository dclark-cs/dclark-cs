### 🔭 About Me
I'm a Computer Science student at Guilford Technical Community College (GTCC) with a strong focus on C++. I practice production‑minded habits—writing tested code, documenting decisions, and shipping small, well‑scoped projects. I’m preparing to transfer to a 4‑year university and applying for the <b>Jack Kent Cooke Undergraduate Transfer Scholarship</b>. I also collaborate with a small marketing team at <a href="https://sinwlkn.dev" target="_blank">sinwlkn.dev</a> (currently under development), gaining experience working across roles and scopes.
